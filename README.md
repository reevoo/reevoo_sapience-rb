## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'reevoo_sapience'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install reevoo_sapience

## Usage

There is nothing to be done here. The gem contains a reevoo specific override `sapience.yml` with the configuration the Reevoo Ltd. company uses internally. It is used to centralize logging, metrics and exception collection within our organization.

Our configuration can be found in [lib/default_reevoo_sapience.yml](https://github.com/reevoo/reevoo_sapience-rb/blob/master/lib/default_reevoo_sapience.yml).
